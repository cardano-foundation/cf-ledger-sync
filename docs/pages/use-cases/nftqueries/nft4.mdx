## 4. Minting an NFT

For this query, we assume that the user and backend server have already generated the policyId, policy script, and the metadata necessary for minting NFTs, following [CIP-25](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-25) and [CIP-68](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-68) standards. In this example, we will focus on CIP-25. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Example of how to create a CIP-68 NFT can be found on GitHub, see [Nicholas Maselli's CIP-68 Showcase](https://github.com/NicholasMaselli/CIP-68Showcase)

Before proceeding, it’s important to understand the requirements for minting an NFT. Although the overall steps are documented on the [Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/minting-nfts/), it’s crucial to note that many of these steps are performed off-chain, typically by the application backend.

To successfully mint an NFT, the backend must query specific data from the database to construct the transaction. 

The required data includes:

- Protocol Parameters: These define various blockchain settings necessary for calculating transaction fees and other parameters.

- UTXOs: The Unspent Transaction Outputs associated with the wallet that will fund the minting transaction.

- Slot/Block Tip: The current slot or block tip to ensure the transaction is valid within the blockchain context.

🔎 Looking a little closer, this query reads data from database, without modifying the blockchain itself. It retrieves information about the protocol parameters for the most recent epoch.

`SELECT` lists the specific columns to retrieve from the database tables.

`FROM epoch_param ep` specifies the main table to query, [epoch_param](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#epoch_param).

`LEFT JOIN cost_model cm ON cm.id = ep.cost_model_id` joins data from the [cost_model](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#cost_model) table based on matching id values.
`ORDER BY epoch_no DESC` sorts the results by `epoch_no` in descending order, ie. most recent epoch first.
`LIMIT 1` restricts the output to only the first row, ie. the most recent epoch's data.

### 4.2 UTXOs associated with specific address 

Let's use address `addr1qyvl8lmwpfq7pahuadpjwul9xlj7c0atr5hvu4r3cjsjlfua276aqezvwjsfucvq76welxmytfyt7ug5835wntzzdvgsyxh7q9` as an example for this query.

```sql
        SELECT 
			tx.hash AS txhash,
			to2."index" AS tx_out_index,
			to2.value AS value,
			to2.address 
		FROM tx_out to2 
		LEFT JOIN tx_in ti ON ti.tx_out_id = to2.tx_id AND ti.tx_out_index = to2."index"
		JOIN tx ON tx.id = to2.tx_id 
		WHERE 
			ti.id IS NULL
			AND to2.address = 'addr1qyvl8lmwpfq7pahuadpjwul9xlj7c0atr5hvu4r3cjsjlfua276aqezvwjsfucvq76welxmytfyt7ug5835wntzzdvgsyxh7q9'

🔎 Looking a little closer, this query returns all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) associated with provided address.

`FROM tx_out to2` starts by selecting all transaction outputs from the [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out) table and assigns them the alias `to2`.
`LEFT JOIN tx_in ti ON ti.tx_out_id = to2.tx_id AND ti.tx_out_index = to2."index"` performs a `LEFT JOIN` with the [tx_in](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_in) table which stores transaction inputs.

The join condition matches `tx_out_id` and `tx_out_index` from [tx_in](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_in) to the corresponding `tx_id` and index from [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out).

A `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all rows from [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out) are included, even if there's no matching row in [tx_in](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_in).

`JOIN tx ON tx.id = to2.tx_id` performs an `INNER JOIN` with the [tx](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx) table, which stores transactions.

This connects each transaction output `to2` to its corresponding transaction `tx` based on the `tx_id`.

`WHERE ti.id IS NULL` is the crucial part for identifying unspent outputs. It filters the results to only include rows where there's NO matching entry in [tx_in](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_in). In other words, these are outputs that haven't been used as inputs in any other transaction yet, hence they are "unspent".

`AND to2.address = 'addr1qyvl8lmwpfq7pahuadpjwul9xlj7c0atr5hvu4r3cjsjlfua276aqezvwjsfucvq76welxmytfyt7ug5835wntzzdvgsyxh7q9'` further filters the results to only show UTXOs belonging to our specific address.

`SELECT tx.hash AS txhash, to2."index" AS tx_out_index, to2.value AS value, to2.address` selects the following columns from the filtered results:
- `tx.hash` ..the transaction hash where the UTXO was created.
- `to2."index"` ...the index of the UTXO within the transaction.
- `to2.value` ...the ADA value (or other asset values) associated with the UTXO.
- `to2.address` ...the address that owns the UTXO

### 4.3 Chain Tip 

```sql

        SELECT
		    block.slot_no,
		    block.block_no,
		    block.epoch_no,
		    block.time
		FROM
		    block
		WHERE block.slot_no IS NOT NULL
		ORDER BY
		    block.slot_no DESC
		LIMIT 1;

```

```
</details>

🔎 Zooming in, this query retrieves information about the chain-tip. In other words, we are looking for the identifier of the most recently processed block on the network.

`SELECT block.slot_no, block.block_no, block.epoch_no, block.time` specifies which columns we want to retrieve from the database. It is looking for:

- `block.slot_no` ...the slot number in which the block was created.
- `block.block_no` ...the block number within its epoch.
- `block.epoch_no` ...the epoch number in which the block was created.
- `block.time` ...the timestamp when the block was created.

`FROM block` ...this tells the database that we want to get this information from a table called `block`.

`WHERE block.slot_no IS NOT NULL` is a filter ensuring that we only get rows (blocks) where the `slot_no` is not empty or null.

`ORDER BY block.slot_no DESC` sorts the results in descending order based on the `slot_no`. This means the block with the highest slot number (the most recent one) will be at the top.

`LIMIT 1` limits the output to only one row. Combined with the sorting, this ensures we only get the most recent block.
