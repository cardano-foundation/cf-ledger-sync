## 3. View all assets that are listed for sale

For this query, we want to list all assets that are listed for sale at an address. In other words, list all the assets locked in a specific smart contract address eg. `addr1x8rjw3pawl0kelu4mj3c8x20fsczf5pl744s9mxz9v8n7efvjel5h55fgjcxgchp830r7h2l5msrlpt8262r3nvr8ekstg4qrx` 

The query returns the following details:
- asset name & policy
- quantity 

```sql
SELECT
		ma.policy AS policy,
		ma.name AS name,
		sum(mto.quantity) AS quantity
	FROM
      	        ma_tx_out mto
	JOIN multi_asset ma 
		ON ma.id = mto.ident 
	JOIN tx_out 
		ON mto.tx_out_id = tx_out.id
	LEFT JOIN tx_in ti 
		ON ti.tx_out_id = tx_out.tx_id AND ti.tx_out_index = tx_out."index"
	WHERE
   	        tx_out.address = 'addr1x8rjw3pawl0kelu4mj3c8x20fsczf5pl744s9mxz9v8n7efvjel5h55fgjcxgchp830r7h2l5msrlpt8262r3nvr8ekstg4qrx'
	   AND ti.tx_out_id is null
	GROUP BY ma.policy, ma.name
	ORDER BY quantity DESC
```

ðŸ”Ž Let's zoom in to understand at each part of the query. 

`FROM ma_tx_out mto` looking at the [ma_tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#ma_tx_out) table, which tracks the association between multi-assets and transaction outputs.

`JOIN multi_asset ma ON ma.id = mto.ident` joins the ma_tx_out table with the [multi_asset](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#multi_asset) table to get details about the assets themselves, such as their policy and name.

`JOIN tx_out ON mto.tx_out_id = tx_out.id` joins with the [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out) table to get information about the transaction outputs where these assets reside, including the address that owns them.

`LEFT JOIN tx_in ti ON ...:` attempts a left join with the [tx_in](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_in) table to identify any transaction inputs that might have spent these transaction outputs.

`WHERE tx_out.address = '...' AND ti.tx_out_id IS NULL` filters the results to only include assets held by the specified address.

The condition `ti.tx_out_id IS NULL` ensures that we only consider transaction outputs that haven't been spent yet.

`GROUP BY ma.policy, ma.name` groups the results by the policy and name of the assets, effectively aggregating multiple entries for the same asset (if they exist in different transaction outputs).

The `SELECT ma.policy AS policy, ma.name AS name, sum(mto.quantity) AS quantity` retrieves the following For each group (i.e., each unique asset): 
- The policy ID.
- The asset name.
- The total quantity of that asset held by the Address

`ORDER BY quantity DESC` sorts the results in descending order based on the quantity of each asset held.
