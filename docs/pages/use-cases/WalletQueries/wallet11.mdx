## 11. Find Active Governance Proposals

To better understand ongoing governance activities in the Cardano ecosystem and gauge community support for each proposal, let's fetch a list of active governance proposals along with relevant details, such as:

- Proposal tx_id
- Index
- Deposit
- Returned address
- Anchor URL (if available)
- Anchor hash (if available)
- Type (one of the [7 governance actions](https://docs.sanchogov.tools/how-to-use-the-govtool/using-govtool/governance-actions))
- Details
- Epoch
- Slot
- Block
- timestamp 
- Number of yes/no/abstain 

Note: Again, we will use the Sanchonet network for this query.

```sql
SELECT 	gap.tx_hash AS tx_id,
		gap.idx AS "index",
		gap.deposit AS deposit,
		gap.return_address AS returned_address,
		gap.anchor_url AS anchor_url,
		gap.anchor_hash AS anchor_hash,
		gap."type" AS "type",
		gap.details AS details,
		gap.epoch AS epoch,
		gap.slot AS slot,
		gap.block AS block,
		gap.update_datetime AS time_stamp,
		(CASE WHEN voting.yes_vote IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE voting.yes_vote END) AS yes_vote,
		(CASE WHEN voting.no_vote IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE voting.no_vote END) AS no_vote,
		(CASE WHEN voting.abstain_vote IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE voting.abstain_vote END) AS abstain_vote
			FROM gov_action_proposal gap
			LEFT JOIN (SELECT 	listVote.gov_action_tx_hash AS gov_action_tx_hash,
						listVote.gov_action_index AS gov_action_index,
						sum(CASE WHEN listVote.vote = 'YES' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS yes_vote,
						sum(CASE WHEN listVote.vote = 'NO' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_vote,
						sum(CASE WHEN listVote.vote = 'ABSTAIN' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abstain_vote
				FROM (	SELECT voter_hash, gov_action_tx_hash, gov_action_index, vote, 
						ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY voter_hash, gov_action_tx_hash, gov_action_index ORDER BY slot DESC) AS rank_slot
				FROM voting_procedure vp 
						) AS listVote
				WHERE rank_slot = 1			
			        GROUP BY listVote.gov_action_tx_hash, listVote.gov_action_index
				) AS voting ON voting.gov_action_tx_hash = gap.tx_hash AND voting.gov_action_index = gap.idx
			WHERE 
				COALESCE(gap.epoch, 0) 
				+ 
				(SELECT COALESCE(ep.gov_action_lifetime, 0) FROM epoch_param ep
					ORDER BY ep.epoch_no DESC LIMIT 1)
				>= 
				(SELECT COALESCE(ep.epoch_no, 0) FROM epoch_param ep
				    ORDER BY ep.epoch_no DESC LIMIT 1)
```

ðŸ”Ž  Here's a breakdown of what the query does:

<Steps>

### Proposal Information Retrieval 

The primary focus of the query is to fetch data from the [gov_action_proposal](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#gov_action_proposal) table (alias `gap`). This returns details like:

- `tx_hash` ...the unique transaction identifier associated with the proposal.
- `idx` ...an index within the transaction.
- `deposit`, `return_address`, `anchor_url`, `anchor_hash` ...proposal-specific metadata.
- `type`, `details`...the nature of the proposal and additional descriptive text.
- `epoch`, `slot`, `block`...information about when the proposal was made.
- `update_datetime` ...the last time this record was modified in the database.

### Voting Data Aggregation

The subquery aliased as `voting` calculates the `yes_vote`, `no_vote`, and `abstain_vote` counts for each proposal. It does this by checking the [voting_procedure](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#voting_procedure) table, filtering for the latest vote from each voter on each proposal `(using ROW_NUMBER() and rank_slot = 1)`. It then groups the results by gov_action_tx_hash and gov_action_index to get totals per proposal.

### Joining Proposal and Voting Data

A `LEFT JOIN` combines the proposal information with the calculated vote counts. This ensures that even proposals without any votes are included in the output, with their vote counts shown as 0.

### Filtering Active Proposals

The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include proposals that are still considered "active" based on:
- The proposal's epoch, when it was made.
- The latest `gov_action_lifetime` parameter from the [epoch_param](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#epoch_param) table, ie. how long proposals remain active.
- The latest `epoch_no` from the [epoch_param](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#epoch_param) table, ie. the current epoch.
