## 4. List all tokens in a wallet

Some assets, particularly NFTs, may include additional information detailed in their metadata. For instance, in-game NFTs can have attributes such as power, speed, and strength encoded in this metadata. This information follows the standards set by various Cardano Improvement Proposals, such as [CIP-25](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-25), which define how metadata should be structured for assets on the Cardano blockchain. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Metadata standards for Cardano are covered in CIPs (Cardano Improvement Proposals) [25](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-25), [26](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0026), [60](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0060) and [68](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0068)

To keep things simple, we will use the same address as before: 

`addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t`

ðŸ”Ž You can also verify the details on one of many Cardano Community Explorers listed [here](https://explorer.cardano.org/en/). For this one, lets use [Cardanoscan](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/address/00fcf0e5bf52973141d84ee25981904f66592164daacffa0695a3a796bd2cfce07b09d41fde7e4e1e4469d5f3e7b563c9870469dd93cb8ee5f) ðŸŽ¯

To retrieve the metadata, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
     ma.fingerprint,
    ma.name AS name,
    sum(mto.quantity) AS quantity
FROM
    ma_tx_out mto
JOIN multi_asset ma 
	ON ma.id = mto.ident 
JOIN tx_out 
	ON mto.tx_out_id = tx_out.id
LEFT JOIN tx_in ti 
	ON ti.tx_out_index = tx_out."index" AND ti.tx_out_id = tx_out.tx_id 
WHERE
    tx_out.address = 'addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t'
    AND ti.tx_out_id is null
GROUP BY ma.fingerprint, ma.name
```

At a high level, we are listing all the distinct tokens (fungible tokens) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) present in our specific Cardano wallet address, along with their respective quantities. This is essential for wallet applications to display a user's asset holdings accurately. We are checking unspent Multi-Asset transaction output from the [ma_tx_out](/../../schema.md#ma_tx_out) table for our specific address. ðŸ”Ž Let's break it down line by line:

<Steps>
### SELECT the right information:

- `ma.fingerprint` ,ie. the unique fingerprint of the token/NFT.
- `ma.name` ...this is the name of the token/NFT (often used to distinguish NFTs).
- `sum(mto.quantity)`, ie. the total quantity of that specific token/NFT held in the wallet, calculated by summing quantities across UTXOs.

### Table JOINs

- `ma_tx_out mto` table stores information about multi-asset quantities within transaction outputs.
- `multi_asset ma` table stores the metadata for each multi-asset.
-  The [tx_out](/../../schema.md#tx_out) table stores general transaction output information.
- `tx_in ti` table stores transaction input information. We use this to check if a UTXO is spent.

### Filters

- `tx_out.address = 'addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t'`...we are filtering for our specific wallet address.
- `ti.tx_out_id IS NULL` is an important condition ensuring we only consider unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) since those are the ones containing the assets currently held in the wallet.

### Grouping and Aggregating

- `GROUP BY ma.fingerprint, ma.name` clause groups the results by the unique fingerprint and name of each token/NFT, enabling us to calculate the total quantity held.
- `SUM(mto.quantity)` calculates the total quantity of each token/NFT by summing up the quantities found in all relevant UTXOs.

### Summary 

- The query looks at all transaction outputs containing multi-assets.
- It checks if the outputs belong to the specified wallet address and are unspent.
- It retrieves the fingerprint and name of the multi-asset from the [multi_asset](/../../schema.md#multi_asset) table.
- It groups the results by fingerprint and name, summing up the quantities to get the total amount of each token/NFT held at our wallet address.
- It returns a list of all the distinct tokens and NFTs in the wallet, along with their respective quantities.
