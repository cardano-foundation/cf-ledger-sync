## 7. Query Active Stake Pools

[Staking](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/) is a big part of the Cardano ecosystem. The more healthy stake pools in operation, the more secure and resilient the network becomes. 

### 7.1 Query all Stake Pools

To get started, the first step is to identify all stake pools. This SQL query retrieves information about each pool's ID, name and creation date.

```sql
select ph.id ,
		po.pool_name as pool_name,
		po.ticker_name as pool_ticker,
		b."time" AS creation_date
	FROM
		pool_hash ph
	LEFT JOIN pool_offline_data po on
		ph.id = po.pool_id
		and (po.id is null
			or po.id = (SELECT max(po2.id)
						FROM pool_offline_data po2
						WHERE po2.pool_id = ph.id))
	LEFT JOIN pool_update pu on
		ph.id = pu.hash_id
		and pu.id = (SELECT	min(pu2.id)
						FROM pool_update pu2
						WHERE pu2.hash_id = ph.id)
	LEFT JOIN tx ON tx.id = pu.registered_tx_id 
	LEFT JOIN block b ON tx.block_id = b.id 
```

ðŸ”Ž Lets examing the inner workings of this query:

<Steps>

### Select Specific Columns

The query gathers the following data to include in the results:

- Pool ID `ph.id`, the unique identifier for each staking pool
- Pool Name `pool_name`, the human-readable name of the pool
- Ticker `pool_ticker`, an abbreviation of the pool
- `creation_date`, the date the pool was created

### Tables Involved

The query traverses several tables (aliases are in brackets):

- [pool_hash](/../../schema.md#pool_hash) (ph) stores the unique hash identifiers for each pool.
- [pool_offline_data](/../../schema.md#pool_offline_data) (po) contains additional information about the pool, such as its name and ticker.
- [pool_update](/../../schema.md#pool_update) (pu) tracks updates or changes made to stake pools. It's joined to find the initial registration transaction of a pool `pu.registered_tx_id`.
- [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) stores transaction data. 
- [block](/../../schema.md#block) (b) stores information about blocks, including their timestamps `b.time`, which are used to determine the pool's creation date.

### Query Explained

`FROM pool_hash ph` selects all rows from the [pool_hash](/../../schema.md#pool_hash) table.

`LEFT JOIN pool_offline_data po on ph.id = po.pool_id and ...` performs a `LEFT JOIN` with [pool_offline_data](/../../schema.md#pool_offline_data) to get the pool's name and ticker. The `ON` clause ensures we get the most recent metadata for each pool:
 - `ph.id = po.pool_id` matches rows based on the pool ID.
 - `(po.id is null or po.id = (SELECT max(po2.id) ...))` is a subquery which selects the maximum `id` from [pool_offline_data](/../../schema.md#pool_offline_data) for the same `pool_id`.
The `OR` condition ensures that if there's no metadata for a pool, it's still included in the result (because of the 
`LEFT JOIN`), but if there is metadata, the latest one is included.

`LEFT JOIN pool_update pu on ph.id = pu.hash_id and ...` performs another `LEFT JOIN` with [pool_update](/../../schema.md#pool_update) to get the pool's registration transaction ID. Again, the `ON` clause ensures we get the earliest update for each pool:
 - `ph.id = pu.hash_id` matches rows based on the pool ID.
 - `pu.id = (SELECT min(pu2.id) ...)` is a subquery which selects the minimum `id` from [pool_update](/../../schema.md#pool_update) for the same `hash_id`
This allows us find the first update, which is the registration.

`LEFT JOIN tx ON tx.id = pu.registered_tx_id` joins with the [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) table to get the transaction details associated with the pool's registration. `LEFT JOIN block b ON tx.block_id = b.id` joins with the [block](/../../schema.md#block) table to get the block where the registration transaction was included.

`SELECT ph.id, COALESCE(po.pool_name, ph."view") as pool_name, ...` selects the pool ID and uses `COALESCE` to get the pool name, prioritizing the one from [pool_offline_data](/../../schema.md#pool_offline_data). It selects the ticker name and the block's timestamp (as `creation_date`)



</Steps>


### 7.2 Query Active Stake Pools

For this second part, we only want data from **active** stake pools. For each active pool, we are retrieving the pool ID, name and creation date. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
[Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io/pools) shows active stake pools by default. There is a toggle button to 'Show Inactive Pools' ðŸ”Ž 
</ Callout>

```sql
select ph.id ,
		COALESCE(po.pool_name, ph."view") as pool_name,
		po.ticker_name as pool_ticker,
		b."time" AS creation_date,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ph.id ASC) 
	FROM
		pool_hash ph
	LEFT JOIN pool_offline_data po on
		ph.id = po.pool_id
		and (po.id is null
			or po.id = (SELECT max(po2.id)
						FROM pool_offline_data po2
						WHERE po2.pool_id = ph.id))
	LEFT JOIN pool_update pu on
		ph.id = pu.hash_id
		and pu.id = (SELECT	min(pu2.id)
						FROM pool_update pu2
						WHERE pu2.hash_id = ph.id)
	LEFT JOIN tx ON tx.id = pu.registered_tx_id 
	LEFT JOIN block b ON tx.block_id = b.id 
	WHERE ph.id NOT IN (SELECT pr.hash_id
				        FROM pool_retire pr
				        LEFT JOIN pool_update pu on	pr.hash_id = pu.hash_id
				        LEFT JOIN pool_hash ph ON ph.id = pr.hash_id
				        GROUP BY pr.hash_id, pu.cert_index, pr.cert_index
				        HAVING (max(pu.registered_tx_id) < max(pr.announced_tx_id))
				        	OR ((max(pu.registered_tx_id) = max(pr.announced_tx_id)) AND (max(pu.cert_index) < max(pr.cert_index)))
						) 
```

ðŸ”Ž Here's a breakdown of how the query works:

<Steps>
### Select Specific Columns

Similar to our first part, we want to retrieve data for the following columns:

- Pool ID `ph.id`, the unique identifier for each staking pool
- Pool Name `pool_name`, the human-readable name of the pool
- Ticker `pool_ticker`, an abbreviation of the pool
- `creation_date`, the date the pool was created

### Tables Involved

Similar to the first part, we are interested in the following tables:  (aliases are in brackets):

- [pool_hash](/../../schema.md#pool_hash) aliased to (ph), [pool_offline_data](/../../schema.md#pool_offline_data) aliased to (po), [pool_update](/../../schema.md#pool_update) aliased to (pu),  [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) and [block](/../../schema.md#block) aliased to (b) 
- In addition, we query the [pool_retire](/../../schema.md#pool_retire) (pr) which holds information about stake pools that have been retired or de-registered.

### `WHERE` clause

Our query here is similar to the first one above, with the addition of the `WHERE` clause.

`WHERE ph.id NOT IN (SELECT ...)` is important for filtering out retired stake pools. The subquery identifies retired pools by comparing the registration and retirement transactions and their certificate indices within those transactions. It ensures that only active pools are included in the final result

`COALESCE(po.pool_name, ph."view") as pool_name` uses `COALESCE` to prioritize the `pool_name` from [pool_offline_data](/../../schema.md#pool_offline_data). If it's null, it falls back to the view from [pool_hash](/../../schema.md#pool_hash). This ensures we have a name for each pool.

`b."time" AS creation_date` retrieves the time from the [block](/../../schema.md#block) table (associated with the pool's registration transaction) and labels it as `creation_date`.

`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ph.id ASC)` assigns a sequential row number to each result row, ordered by the pool hash ID in ascending order. This can be useful for pagination or displaying results in a numbered list.

</Steps>

The **next query** will provide users with detailed information about specific stake pools. This will help them make informed decisions when selecting a specific pool to delegate their ADA.
