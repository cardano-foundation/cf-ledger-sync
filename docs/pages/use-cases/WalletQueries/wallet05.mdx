## 5. Query collection details

To keep things simple, we will use the same address as before: 

`addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t`

üîé You can also verify the details on [Cardano Blockchain Explorer](https://preprod.beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/address/addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t) üéØ

For this example, we are querying this specific token `asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm`. We want to retrieve the following details: a) Script hash, b) Total supply, c)creation date, d) Number of holders, e) Number of transactions in the past week.

```sql
SELECT
		ma.policy AS scriptHash,
		ma.supply AS totalSupply,
		ma.time AS createdDate,
		num_of_holders.numHolder,
		num_of_tx.numTx
	FROM
		preprod.multi_asset ma
	LEFT JOIN (
			SELECT ma.fingerprint AS fingerprint, COUNT(DISTINCT tx.id) AS numTx
			FROM tx
			LEFT JOIN tx_out txo ON tx.id = txo.tx_id 
			JOIN block b ON b.id = tx.block_id 
			JOIN ma_tx_out mto ON txo.id = mto.tx_out_id
			JOIN multi_asset ma ON mto.ident = ma.id
			WHERE
			   ma.fingerprint = 'asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm'
			   AND b.time > (now() at time zone 'utc') - INTERVAL '7 days'
			GROUP BY ma.fingerprint
			) AS num_of_tx ON num_of_tx.fingerprint = ma.fingerprint
	LEFT JOIN (
			SELECT ma.fingerprint AS fingerprint, COUNT(DISTINCT(sa.id)) AS numHolder
			FROM ma_tx_out mto
			LEFT JOIN tx_out to2 ON mto.tx_out_id = to2.id
			LEFT JOIN tx_in ti ON ti.tx_out_index = to2."index"
				AND ti.tx_out_id = to2.tx_id
			JOIN multi_asset ma ON ma.id = mto.ident
			LEFT JOIN stake_address sa ON sa.id = to2.stake_address_id
			WHERE
				ma.fingerprint = 'asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm'
				AND ti.id IS NULL
				AND sa.id IS NOT NULL
			GROUP BY ma.fingerprint
			) AS num_of_holders ON num_of_holders.fingerprint = ma.fingerprint
	WHERE
		ma.fingerprint = 'asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm'
```

üîé We can always cross check our results on any Cardano Explorer, such as [cexplorer](https://preprod.cexplorer.io/policy/698a6ea0ca99f315034072af31eaac6ec11fe8558d3f48e9775aab9d#data) üéØ

üßê Let's breakdown the query line by line:

<Steps>

### Data Sources

The query traverses multiple tables to find the requested details:

-  [multi_asset](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#multi_asset) (alias ma) table stores information about the asset itself.
-  [tx](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx), ie. transaction data.
-  [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out)stores transaction output data, where assets end up after a transaction.
-  [block](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#block) refers to blockchain block data. Transactions are grouped into blocks.
-  [ma_tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#ma_tx_out) table links multi-asset entries to transaction outputs.
-  [stake_address](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#stake_address) table stores information about wallet addresses.

### Main Query (SELECT...FROM)

- The query starts by selecting the desired columns from the [multi_asset](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#multi_asset) table.
- It filters for the target asset using it's unique fingerprint `asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm`

### First Subquery (LEFT JOIN...num_of_tx)

- This subquery calculates the number of transactions within the past 7 days for our specific asset.
- It joins transaction data with block data to filter by time.
- It groups the results by the asset's fingerprint and counts distinct transaction IDs.

### Second Subquery (LEFT JOIN...num_of_holders)

- This subquery calculates the number of distinct holders of the asset.
- It queries transaction outputs `tx_out` and the links to multi-assets.
- It filters out transaction outputs that are inputs to other transactions.
- It counts distinct stake addresses associated with the remaining outputs, where each address represents a holder.

### Joining Subqueries

- The main query uses a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the results of the two subqueries back to the main [multi_asset](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#multi_asset) table.
- The LEFT JOIN ensures that the main query returns a row even if the subqueries don't find matching data (in that case, `num_of_tx` and `num_of_holders` would be NULL).

### Summary 

- A fingerprint is a unique identifier used to distinguish different assets on the Cardano blockchain.
- The `LEFT JOIN` type of join ensures you get results even if there's no matching data in the joined tables.
- Subqueries are used to calculate more complex values like transaction counts and holder counts that can't be directly derived from a single table.
