## 3. Review wallet transaction history

For consistency, we will query the same preprod address as before: 
`addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t`

ðŸ”Ž You can verify results using any of the community explorers listed [here](https://explorer.cardano.org/en/). 

[CardanoScan search](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/address/00fcf0e5bf52973141d84ee25981904f66592164daacffa0695a3a796bd2cfce07b09d41fde7e4e1e4469d5f3e7b563c9870469dd93cb8ee5f) (remember to choose 'Preprod' in the top right)

We will break the query up into three parts to fetch the information we need for the overall query.

### 3.1 Transaction details

First, let's determine which transaction details we want to collect:

- amount of ADA transferred
- if the transaction is incoming/outgoing
- transaction fee 
- assets (name and quantity) 
- transaction hash 
- Timestamp 
- Slot/Block 

```sql
-- Transactions where the address is the output
SELECT
	COALESCE(sum(tx_out.value), 0) - COALESCE(inp.inp_value, 0) AS ADA_amount,
	'outgoing' AS direction,
	tx.fee AS fee,
	tx.hash AS tx_hash,
	block."time" AS time_stamp,
	block.block_no AS block,
	block.slot_no AS slot
FROM tx_out
JOIN tx ON tx.id = tx_out.tx_id
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT
		tx.id AS inp_txid,
		tx.hash AS inp_hash,
		tx_out.address AS source_add,
		sum(tx_out.value) AS inp_value
           FROM tx_in
	   JOIN tx_out ON tx_out.tx_id = tx_in.tx_out_id
		    AND tx_out.index = tx_in.tx_out_index
    	   JOIN tx ON tx.id = tx_in.tx_in_id
	   WHERE
		tx_out.address = 'addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t'
           GROUP BY
		inp_txid,
		inp_hash,
		source_add
    		) 
    	AS inp ON inp.inp_txid = tx.id
JOIN block ON block.id = tx.block_id
WHERE
	tx_out.address = 'addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t'
GROUP BY
	tx_hash,
	direction,
	fee,
	time_stamp,
	block,
	slot,
	inp.inp_value


UNION


-- Transactions where the address is the input and not an output
SELECT
    sum(tx_out.value) AS ADA_amount,
	'incoming' AS direction,
	tx.fee AS fee,
	tx.hash AS tx_hash,
	block."time" AS time_stamp,
	block.block_no AS block,
	block.slot_no AS slot
FROM tx_in
JOIN tx_out ON tx_out.tx_id = tx_in.tx_out_id
			AND tx_out.index = tx_in.tx_out_index
JOIN tx ON tx.id = tx_in.tx_in_id
JOIN block ON block.id = tx.block_id
WHERE
	tx_out.address = 'addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t'
	AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 AS txid
					FROM tx_out
					WHERE
						tx_out.address = 'addr_test1qr70pedl22tnzswcfm39nqvsfan9jgtym2k0lgrftga8j67jel8q0vyag8770e8pu3rf6he70dtrexrsg6waj09cae0svmt57t'

</details>

The overall aim is to track the flow of ADA for our specific address. It categorizes transactions as 'outgoing' or 'incoming' and provides details like the amount, fee, timestamp, and block information. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
- When we say "outgoing", this is the address that is in the output of that transaction, and possibly the input as well (if they are receiving any change back).
- When we say "incoming", this is the address in the input part of that transaction, and not in the output part.
</Callout>

ðŸ”Ž Let's take a closer look at each part of the query. 

<Steps>

### First Part (Before UNION)

`SELECT COALESCE(sum(tx_out.value), 0) - COALESCE(inp.inp_value, 0) AS ADA_amount, 'outgoing' AS direction, ...`

This SELECT statement calculates the net ADA amount involved in transactions where the given address is an output, ie. recipient.
`COALESCE` ensures that if `sum(tx_out.value)` or `inp.inp_value` is NULL, they are treated as 0, preventing errors.
`outgoing` labels these transactions as outgoing.

`FROM tx_out JOIN tx ON tx.id = tx_out.tx_id ...` 
This FROM statement starts by looking at [tx_out](/../../schema.md#tx_out) (transaction outputs) and joins it with the [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) 
(transactions) table, linking them based on transaction IDs.

`LEFT JOIN ( SELECT ... ) AS inp ON inp.inp_txid = tx.id` is a subquery aliased as `inp`. It looks for transactions where the given address is an input (or sender) and calculates the total input value `inp_value` for those transactions. 

`LEFT JOIN` includes all rows from the left table [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) even if there's no match in the subquery `inp`. 

`JOIN block ON block.id = tx.block_id` joins the [block](/../../schema.md#block) table to get block-related information (timestamp, block number, slot number).

`WHERE tx_out.address = '...'` filters results to only include transactions where the specified address is an output. 

`GROUP BY tx_hash, ...` groups the results by transaction hash and other fields to avoid duplicate rows.

`UNION` combines the results of the first part with the second part.

### Second Part (After UNION)

`SELECT sum(tx_out.value) AS ADA_amount, 'incoming' AS direction, ...` calculates the total ADA amount for incoming transactions. 

`incoming` labels these transactions as incoming. `FROM tx_in JOIN tx_out ON ... JOIN tx ON ... JOIN block ON ...` similar joins as in the first part, but starts from [tx_in](/../../schema.md#tx_in) (transaction inputs).

`WHERE tx_out.address = '...' AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 AS txid FROM tx_out WHERE ...)` filters to include transactions where:
- The address is an input (via [tx_out](/../../schema.md#tx_out) linked to [tx_in](/../../schema.md#tx_in)).
- The address is not an output in the same transaction (using NOT EXISTS).

`GROUP BY tx_hash, ...` groups the results similarly to the first part.
</Steps>

### 3.2 Retrieve Transaction signatories

Next we will run a query to get the transaction signatories. :writing_hand:

For that, we will be using the transaction hash `3565bb0621d56ff3349f014a41c7c4c9f5614288a4b00abbe76d3b41becc9da7` as it has more than one signer keys.

```sql
SELECT tw."key" AS Transaction_Signatories
			FROM tx
			LEFT JOIN tx_witnesses tw ON tx.id = tw.tx_id
			WHERE tx.hash = '3565bb0621d56ff3349f014a41c7c4c9f5614288a4b00abbe76d3b41becc9da7'
```

<details>
<summary>
Expected results format
</summary>

```sql
     transaction_signatories
----------------------------------------------------------------
1fdbf347cae52d54a9cf7f58e4ecf461144bbfb38a330dce3e8d66f1391bc442
55ff3b5b6603609463566057e0713cb2db512838eb864a0c15d73b377c278ae3

(2 rows)
```

</details>


ðŸ”Ž  Let's take a closer look at each part of the query. 

`SELECT tw."key" AS Transaction_Signatories` selects the `key` column from the [tx_witnesses](/../../schema.md#tx_witnesses) table and renames it as `Transaction_Signatories` in the output.

`FROM tx` means the query is looking in the [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) table.

`LEFT JOIN tx_witnesses tw ON tx.id = tw.tx_id` performs a LEFT JOIN with the [tx_witnesses](/../../schema.md#tx_witnesses) table.
`LEFT JOIN tx_witnesses tw ON tx.id = tw.tx_id` performs a LEFT JOIN with the [tx_witnesses](/../../schema.md#tx_witnesses) table.

The `JOIN` condition `tx.id = tw.tx_id` connects rows from both tables where the `id` in the [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) table matches the `tx_id` in the [tx_witnesses](/../../schema.md#tx_witnesses) table.

`LEFT JOIN` ensures that all rows from the [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) table are included in the result, even if there's no corresponding match in the [tx_witnesses](/../../schema.md#tx_witnesses) table. In such cases, the columns from [tx_witnesses](/../../schema.md#tx_witnesses) will have NULL values.

`WHERE tx.hash = '3565bb0621d56ff3349f014a41c7c4c9f5614288a4b00abbe76d3b41becc9da7'` is a filtering condition restricting the output to only those rows where the hash column in the [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) table matches the provided specific hash value.

### 3.3 Retrieve Native Asset details

While reviewing the above transactions, you might notice that some include more than just ADA, they also include *[Cardano Native Assets](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-cli/native-assets/)*.

Next we will run a query get the details of a specific transaction which includes a native asset. We will use the transaction hash `3565bb0621d56ff3349f014a41c7c4c9f5614288a4b00abbe76d3b41becc9da7` because this transaction has native assets, in addtion to ada.

```sql

SELECT tx_detail.* FROM (	
			SELECT 
				'output' AS direction,
				tx_out.address AS address,
				sa."view" AS stake_address,
				tx_out.value AS ADA_amount,

				sum(mto.quantity) AS quantity,
				b.time AS time_stamp,
				tx.fee AS transaction_fee,

			GROUP BY direction, address, stake_address, ADA_amount, asset_name, time_stamp, transaction_fee, block, slot, utxo

			GROUP BY direction, address, stake_address, ADA_amount, asset_name, time_stamp, transaction_fee, block, slot, utxo
				) AS tx_detail
ORDER BY tx_detail.direction ASC

ðŸ”Ž  Let's zoom in for a closer look at each part of the query. 

<Steps>
### Two Subqueries Combined with UNION ALL

The main query selects everything prefixed `tx_detail` by combining the results of two subqueries using `UNION ALL` which appends the results of the second subquery to the first, without removing duplicates.

### First Subquery focuses on Outputs

`SELECT 'output' AS direction, ...` labels each row as an 'output'.
`FROM tx LEFT JOIN tx_out ...` starts from the [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) table and joins with [tx_out](/../../schema.md#tx_out) (transaction outputs) table to get output details.
`LEFT JOIN stake_address ...` joins with `stake_address` to get associated stake address information.
`LEFT JOIN ma_tx_out ... LEFT JOIN multi_asset ...` joins to gather details about any native assets involved in the outputs.
`LEFT JOIN block b ...` joins with [block](/../../schema.md#block) to get block-related info.  
`WHERE tx.hash = '...'` filters to focus only on the specific transaction.
`GROUP BY ...` groups results to avoid redundancy, especially when multiple native assets are involved in an output.
`NULL AS utxo` sets the utxo column to `NULL` for outputs, as UTXOs are relevant to inputs.

### Second Subquery focuses on Inputs

`SELECT 'input' AS direction, ...` labels each row as an 'input'.
`FROM tx LEFT JOIN tx_in ...` starts from [tx](/../../schema.md#tx) table and joins with [tx_in](/../../schema.md#tx_in) (transaction inputs) table.
`LEFT JOIN tx_out ... LEFT JOIN tx txin ...` traces back from the input to the original output it's spending, to get details about that output.
Other joins and `WHERE` clause are similar to the first subquery.
`txin.hash AS utxo` includes the hash of the transaction that created the spent output, representing the UTXO.

### Main Query

`SELECT tx_detail.* FROM (...) AS tx_detail` selects all columns from the combined results of the subqueries.
`ORDER BY tx_detail.direction ASC` orders the results, showing outputs first, then inputs.

### Summary

This query gives you a detailed breakdown of the inputs and outputs of the Cardano transaction we are interested in.

Next, we will run a query to fetch a breakdown list of all the native tokens (both fungible tokens and NFTs) held in the wallet. This will provide a detailed view of your various assets, allowing you to see each token or NFT along with its name and quantity.
</Steps>
