## 10. List the current dReps

Another important feature Cardano Blockchain implements is governance, where the goal is put decision-making on chain, and in the hands of the community. To read more about the [CIP-1694](https://www.1694.io/en) roadmap [here](https://www.intersectmbo.org/roadmap), visit or catch up on the latest news on [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). 

This query provides a list of dReps currently registered on the system and additional information including:

- dRep ID
- tx_id of the registration
- cert index
- type 
- deposit
- hash of the pool which we it is delegating to
- credential type
- anchor URL 
- anchor hash 
- dRep status (active / inactive)
- registration date 
- epoch
- block
- slot
- number of delegators  

This information helps you understand who is voting on proposals and shaping the future of the Cardano ecosystem. Note that we are using the [Sanchonet](https://sancho.network/) network for this query, which queries the same database schema as mainnet.

Let's take a closer look at what the query does. ðŸ”Ž  

<Steps>

### Main `SELECT` Clause

`SELECT`s various columns from the [drep_registration](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#drep_registration) table (alias `dr`) such as `drep_id`, `drep_hash`, `tx_id`, `cert_index`, `type`, `deposit`, `cred_type`, `anchor_url`, `anchor_hash`, `epoch`, `block`, and `slot`.

### `CASE` Statement for `dRep_status`

Calculates the `dRep_status` based on the following logic:
- `INACTIVE`...If the sum of `vp.epoch` (from the [voting_procedure](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#voting_procedure) table) and the latest `drep_activity` from [epoch_param](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#epoch_param) is less than the latest `epoch_n` from [epoch_param](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#epoch_param). This likely indicates the dRep hasn't been active in recent epochs.
- `RETIRED` If the type in [drep_registration](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#drep_registration) is `UNREG_DREP_CERT`, meaning the dRep has been unregistered.
- `ACTIVE`... otherwise, the dRep is considered active.

### `registration_date` Calculation

Converts the `block_time` (from the [drep_registration](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#drep_registration) table) to a timestamp with UTC timezone.
The subquery `sub2` fetches the maximum `block_time` for each `drep_hash` where the `type` is 'REG_DREP_CERT' (registration certificate).

### `number_of_delegators` Calculation

Uses a `LEFT JOIN` with a subquery `sub3` to count the number of distinct delegators `address` associated with each `drep_hash` in the [delegation_vote](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#delegation_vote) table. `COALESCE` ensures that if there are no delegators, the count is shown as 0.

### Joins and Subqueries

`JOIN with sub1` ensures only the latest registration entry for each `drep_hash` is considered (based on the maximum slot).
`LEFT JOIN` with `sub3` and `vp` brings in the delegators count and latest voting epoch information for each dRep.
