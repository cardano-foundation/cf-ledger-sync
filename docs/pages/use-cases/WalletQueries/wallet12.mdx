## 12. Smart contract transaction data 

For our final query, we will inspect the details of a specific transaction, namely, the transaction id `52385f2dd6b69eb035474b529249afda132cde54f54c727842393edc51bebb57`. Note we are not modifying the blockchain in any way, we are just reading data from it.

For most users, the wallet is their gateway when interacting with dApps (decentralized applications) on Cardano. There is even a [CIP-30](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30) outlining a consistent standard for developers to follow. For example, when a user swaps a token on a dApp, the wallet securely signs the transaction, and this transaction typically triggers smart contract(s). Most smart contracts on Cardano are written in Aiken. To learn more, head over to [aiken-lang.org](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/getting-started) where you will find some excellent primers and guides. Learn how Aiken's compiler and standard library enforce safe patterns to aid in secure code. Add to that a full-blown property test framework, you can be confident Aiken is fully equipped for high assurance.

### 12.1 Transaction information

Let's start by retrieving the transaction details:
- transaction hash
- timestamp
- block
- fee
- epoch
- slot
- source address
- destination address
- assets
- amount
- UTXOs used

```sql
SELECT tx_detail.* FROM (
	SELECT 
		'destination_address' AS direction,
		tx.hash AS txhash,
		tx_out.address AS address,
		sa."view" AS stake_address,

ðŸ”Ž Let's zoom in to see what the query does step-by-step:

<Steps>

### Overall query structure

To find the information we need, the query focuses on two perspectives:

- **Destination Addresses:** Where did the funds/assets end up?
- **Source Addresses:** Where did the funds/assets come from?

`UNION ALL` combines the results from the two separate `SELECT` statements. Each `SELECT` statement targets one of the perspectives above.

### Destination Addresses, the first `SELECT`

It fetches details about the outputs [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out) of the transaction. It then links to other tables to fetch further information such as:
    - Stake address associated with the output
    - Asset names and quantities 
    - Block, slot, and epoch details of the transaction
    - Transaction fee

### Source Addresses, the second `SELECT`

This `SELECT` statement looks back to the inputs [tx_in](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_in) of the transaction. It traces the chain of transactions to find the original outputs [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out) that were spent as inputs in this transaction. It retrieves similar information as the first `SELECT`, but additionally includes the 'utxo' (unspent transaction output) hash which represents the specific output that was spent.

### Result returned

The two result sets are combined with a `UNION ALL` clause, and the final output is sorted by `direction` so that `destination_address` rows appear before `source_address` rows in the results.

</Steps>

### 12.2 Contracts details 

For this query, we are looking for the Redeemer, datum hash and datum associated with the transaction. A good recap on there terms is available on [Aiken-lang.org](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/eutxo).

```sql
SELECT 
	re.script_hash AS scriptHash, 
	txOut.address AS address, 
	re.purpose as purpose,
        encode(rd.bytes, 'hex') as redeemerData, 
        re.unit_mem as redeemerMem, 
        re.unit_steps as redeemerSteps,
        d.hash as datumHash, 
        encode(d.bytes, 'hex') as datum
           FROM tx
           INNER JOIN redeemer re ON re.tx_id = tx.id 
           LEFT JOIN redeemer_data rd ON re.redeemer_data_id = rd.id 
           LEFT JOIN tx_in txIn ON (txIn.redeemer_id = re.id and txIn.tx_in_id = tx.id)
           LEFT JOIN tx_out txOut ON txIn.tx_out_id = txOut.tx_id AND txIn.tx_out_index = txOut.index
           LEFT JOIN datum d ON (txOut.data_hash = d.hash OR txOut.inline_datum_id = d.id)
           WHERE tx.hash = '52385f2dd6b69eb035474b529249afda132cde54f54c727842393edc51bebb57'

</details>

ðŸ”Ž Let's zoom in to see what the query does step-by-step:

<Steps>

### Target transaction

`WHERE tx.hash = '...'` filters to the specific transaction we are interested in.

### Redeemer details
`INNER JOIN redeemer re ON re.tx_id = tx.id` ensures we only consider redeemers associated with the target transaction. `re.script_hash`, `re.purpose`, `re.unit_mem`, `re.unit_steps` fetch the script hash the redeemer interacts with, its purpose, memory usage, and computational steps, respectively.

### Redeemer Data
`LEFT JOIN redeemer_data rd ON re.redeemer_data_id = rd.id` brings in redeemer data if it exists. `encode(rd.bytes, 'hex') as redeemerData` converts the raw redeemer data into a human-readable hexadecimal format.

### Transaction input and output JOIN
`LEFT JOIN tx_in txIn ON ...` joins the transaction input that triggered the redeemer to the transaction itself. `LEFT JOIN tx_out txOut ON ...` links this input with the specific transaction output it spends from. `txOut.address` extracts the address of the output being spent.

### Datum information 
`LEFT JOIN datum d ON ...` attempts to find a datum linked to the spent output, either through a hash reference or an inline datum.
`d.hash` and `encode(d.bytes, 'hex') as datum` provide the datum hash and its hexadecimal representation.

### Output 

The query will produce a result set containing:

- `scriptHash` ...the script hash the redeemer interacts with.
- `address`...the address of the UTxO spent by the transaction input.
- `purpose`...the purpose of the redeemer 
- `redeemerData`...the Hex-encoded redeemer data (if present).
- `redeemerMem` & `redeemerSteps`...the redeemer's memory & computational step usage.
- `datumHash`...the hash of the datum associated with the spent output.
- `datum` ...the hex-encoded datum content (if present).

```

</details>

ðŸ”Ž Let's zoom in to see what the query does step-by-step:

<Steps>

### First `SELECT`

The `FROM unconsume_tx_in cti` clause starts by looking at unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that have been used as inputs in some other transaction. The `INNER JOIN tx_out txOut ...` joins with the [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out) table to get details about these UTXOs, ie. address, value, index within the transaction. 

The `LEFT JOIN tx ON ...` attempts to join with the [tx](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx) table to see if there's a transaction where this UTXO was used as an input.

The `JOIN tx txin ON ...` clause also joins with the [tx](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx) table again (alias `txin`) to get details about the transaction where this UTXO was originally created as an output.

The `WHERE tx.hash = ...` clause filters the results to only include UTXOs that were used as inputs in the specific transaction we specified. The `'input' AS collateral` clause labels these results as 'input' in the `collateral` column.

### Second `SELECT`

The `FROM failed_tx_out failedTxOut` looks at outputs from transactions that failed. The `INNER JOIN tx ON ...` clause joins with the [tx](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx) table to get details about the failed transaction.

The `WHERE tx.hash = ...` clause filters the results to only include outputs from the specific failed transaction we're interested in. The `'output' AS collateral` clause labels these results as 'output' in the `collateral` column.

### `UNION`

The `UNION` clause combines the results from the two parts into a single result set:
- `collateral` indicates whether the row represents a transaction input or an output
- `address` ...ie, the address associated with the input or output
- `value` is the amount of ADA (or other assets) associated with the input or output
- `index` tells us the position of the input or output within its transaction

</Steps>

### 12.4 Reference input and contract reference

Our final query aims to retrieve details about the outputs (UTXOs) that were **spent** as inputs in our specific transaction, identified by its hash `52385f2dd6b69eb035474b529249afda132cde54f54c727842393edc51bebb57`. 

```sql
	  SELECT 
  		txOut.address as address,
     		tx.hash as txHash, 
      		txOut.value as value, 
      		r.tx_out_index as index
           FROM reference_tx_in r
           JOIN tx_out txOut ON r.tx_out_id = txOut.tx_id AND txOut.index = r.tx_out_index
           JOIN tx ON txOut.tx_id = tx.id 
	   JOIN tx txin ON txin.id = r.tx_in_id 
           WHERE 
		txin.hash = '52385f2dd6b69eb035474b529249afda132cde54f54c727842393edc51bebb57'

ðŸ”Ž Let's zoom in to see what the query does step-by-step:

<Steps>

### Query structure

The `FROM reference_tx_in r` starts by looking at the [reference_tx_in](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#reference_tx_in) table, which stores information about transaction inputs and the UTXOs they reference.

`JOIN tx_out txOut ON ...`  joins with the [tx_out](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_out) table to get details about these UTXOs, ie. address, value, index within the transaction. 

`JOIN tx ON txOut.tx_id = tx.id` joins with the [tx](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx) table to get information about the transaction where these UTXOs were created as outputs.

`JOIN tx txin ON txin.id = r.tx_in_id` joins with the [tx](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx) table again (aliase `txin`) to get details about the transaction where these UTXOs were spent as inputs.

The `WHERE txin.hash = ...` clause filters the results to only include UTXOs that were spent as inputs in the specific transaction we're interested in.

### Results

- `address` is the address associated with the spent UTXO
- `txHash` is the hash of the transaction where this UTXO was created as an output
- `value` is the amount of ADA (or other assets) associated with the spent UTXO
- `index` is the position of the UTXO within the transaction where it was created
