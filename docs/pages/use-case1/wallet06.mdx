## 6. Query Token metadata information

In this SQL query, we retrieve the JSON metadata associated with a specific asset by joining multiple tables and applying filters.

```sql
SELECT tm.json
FROM ma_tx_mint mtm
JOIN tx_metadata tm ON tm.tx_id = mtm.tx_id
JOIN multi_asset ma ON ma.id = mtm.ident
WHERE
    ma.fingerprint = 'asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm'
    AND tm.key = 721
ORDER BY
    mtm.id DESC
LIMIT 1
```

               "https://dripdropz.io"
            ]
         }
      }
   }
```

</details>

üîé Here's a breakdown of how this query works:

<Steps>
### Select JSON Metadata:

```sql
SELECT tm.json
```

This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the `json` column from the [tx_metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_metadata) table.

### From ma_tx_mint Table with Joins

```sql
FROM ma_tx_mint mtm
JOIN tx_metadata tm ON tm.tx_id = mtm.tx_id
JOIN multi_asset ma ON ma.id = mtm.ident
```

The data is being retrieved from the [ma_tx_mint](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#ma_tx_mint) table, aliased as `mtm`.

The query joins the [tx_metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_metadata) table `tm`, using the `tx_id` (transaction id) column. The [multi_asset](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#multi_asset) table, alised `ma`, is joined with the `indent` column. using `ma.id = mtm.ident`.

### Filter by Fingerprint and Metadata Key

```sql
WHERE
    ma.fingerprint = 'asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm'
    AND tm.key = 721
```

This condition filters the rows to include only those where the `ma.fingerprint` matches our specific native asset id `asset1nvcwnq60jnm27efjm87xnhqt6alsv024tdyxjm`. `tm.key = 721` is referring to `721` which is the metatdata standard for NFTs on Cardano. 

### Order and Limit the Results

```sql
ORDER BY
    mtm.id DESC
LIMIT 1
```

The results are ordered by `mtm.id` in descending order, which means the most recent entry comes first. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the most recent entry is returned.

### Conclusion
The query retrieves the JSON metadata for a specific asset by:

- Joining the [ma_tx_mint](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#ma_tx_mint), [tx_metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#tx_metadata), and [multi_asset](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync/blob/main/docs/pages/schema.md#multi_asset) tables from Cardano's database schema.
- Filtering by the asset's fingerprint and extract the JSON metadata associated with the minting transaction, specifically the metadata related to the NFT standard (721). This metadata contains details about the NFT's name, image, policy ID, etc.
- Ordering by the most recent minting transaction and limiting the result to one.

</Steps>

Now that you understood about metadata and have a list of all the assets, you may want to gather more details about a specific collection. This could include information such as the policy ID of the collection, the creation date, the number of assets minted, the number of owners, number of transactions in the last 24 hours, and any unique attributes associated with it.
